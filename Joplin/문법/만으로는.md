Let’s take a stroll alongside the river of korean particles and talk about the  **만으로는**  grammar pattern?

This pattern combines three individual particles and forges them into one without sacrificing their own meanings. So essentially, 만으로는 is made up of multiple particles stacked on top of each other and takes on a meaning along the lines of “only with…” “only on the basis of…” “using only…” etc…

1.  만 – only
2.  으로 – using / by the means of / with
3.  는 – contrast marker/emphasis marker

#### Usage

- Noun+ 만으로는

- Only nouns, or verbs conjugated into nouns, can be used.

#### A Closer Look

One thing to note about this grammar is that  *following*  *clause*  should be  **negative**. This is because of that last little part “**는**” which emphasizes that using  *ONLY*  \[noun\] won’t do and that you would need something more. So it’s natural to follow up with words like:

- “가능하지 않다”
- “부족하다”
- “못하다”
- “-ㄹ 수 없다”
- -기 어렵다
- etc…

If you were to drop “**는**” and only use “**만으로**” you could use positive or neutral sentences  *as well*  as negative sentences. To illustrate this, let’s look at an example.

사랑<ins>만으로</ins>  결혼할  <ins>수 있다</ins> **(O)**

**= You can get married only on the basis of love**

사랑만으로<ins>는</ins>  결혼할  <ins>수 없다</ins>  **(O)**

**= You can’t get married  *only*  on the basis of love**

사랑만으로<ins>는</ins> 결혼할 <ins>수 있다</ins>  **(X)** –  *This does not work because the following clause should be **negative**.*

~~**= You can get married only on the basis of love**~~
