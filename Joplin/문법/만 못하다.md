~만 못하다 (man mo-ta-da) – (A) is not as (adjective) as (B)

This is quite similar to 보다 더 in that you would use 만 못하다 to do a comparison between two nouns too.

When the first noun (attach subject marker) of the sentence is worse off than the second noun (without any marker), you attach 만 못하다 to the back of the second noun.

Examples: 건강에 좋고 맛있는 음식은  **주스가 과일만 못해**.

In terms of being good for health and taste,  **juices aren’t as good as fruits**.
