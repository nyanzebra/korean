Learn Korean Ep. 45: Make & Let
Let’s learn how to say “make” and “let” in Korean. For example, how to say “I let him eat” or
“I made him eat.”
v.s + 게 하다
This form can mean either “to make” or “to let.” Which one it is will be clear from the
context of the sentence.
Take the verb stem and add “게,” then conjugate the verb “하다.”
강아지가 초콜릿을 먹게 하지 마.
“Don’t let the puppy eat chocolate.”
Although you could translate this as “don’t make the dog eat chocolate,” in this context it
probably makes more sense for it to be “let.”
내가 또 말하게 하지 마.
“Don’t make me say it again.”
v.s + 게 해주다
This form is made in the same way as the one above, but with the verb “주다” attached to
the end. You can learn about how to use the verb “해주다” (“to do as a favor”) in another
one of my lessons (Episode 36: “I’ll do it for you”).
저 좀 자게 해주세요.
“Please let me sleep.”
“좀” is an abbreviation of “조금.”
티비를 볼 수 있게 해주세요.
Literal: “Please let me be able to watch TV.”
Meaning: “Please let me watch TV.”

v.s + 게 만들다
This form means only “to make,” and it even uses the verb “만들다” (“to make”).
Take the verb stem and add “게,” then conjugate the verb “만들다.”
철수를 화나게 만들었어.
“I made Cheolsoo get angry.”
“화나다” means “to get angry.”
친구들이 싸우게 만들었어.
“I made my friends fight.”
“싸우다” means “to fight.”
Remember that all of these verbs are action verbs, and not adjectives or descriptive verbs.
Advanced Notes
I’d recommend only reading these advanced notes if you are at an intermediate level or higher.
시키다
“시키다” is a verb which means “to make” or “to let” in and of itself. It can be used as a replacement for the verb
“하다” (“to do”).
일을 시키다
“to make someone work”
청소를 시키다
“to make someone do cleaning”
For all other situations other than replacing the verb “하다,” use one of the forms learned above.
In addition, “피자(를) 시키다” means “to order a pizza.”
