#### Positives

#### Negatives

- 어머니가 걱정하지 않도록 전화했어요. – In order for my mum not to worry, I called her.

So, you can see that “도록” is still used to indicate a purpose or intention, but when used with the negative form of a verb, it indicates the intention to avoid or not do something.

If used as a sentence ending then it can be like "till", "until" or "to the point"
