### Usage
This expression is used when attempting to infer or guess the circumstances of a particular situation after directly seeing it or hearing about it. It can be translated as 'seems like', 'appears like' and is very similar to grammar pattern -ㄴ/은/는 것 같다. However -(으)ㄴ/는 모양이다 expresses not just a random guess but something based on certain evidences/circumstances.
