## Expressing surprise #card

### Usage
#### 네요
If you want to express surprise in Korean, you can use -네요. This can give the nuance of “wow” or something like that.
#### 군요 / 구나
-군요 / -구나 is another way of expressing surprise, but it’s generally used in more formal situations (although you can use it informally if you wanted to).
### Form
#### 네요
| -   | 과거   | 현재   |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| 동사  | 했네요  | 하네요  |

### Examples
#### 네요
- 학점이 진짜 좋아요.
	- Your grades are really good.
- 학점이 진짜 좋네요. 
	- Your grades are really good.

These two sentences have the same literal translation, but the one ending in -네요 gives the nuance of “wow, your grades are really high” or “I didn’t know your grades were so high” – it expresses more surprise than the first one.

Let’s see more examples:

- 배구를 잘 하네요.
