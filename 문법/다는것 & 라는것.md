### Usage
- Noun + -(이)라는 것
    - What I call “Noun” is…
    - (I think that) “Noun” is…
    - Comes from the construction (이)라고 하는 것
- Verb + -(ㄴ/는)다는 것
    - “The thing that is called + Verb” and it is used to express what you think the definition or nature of a certain/state/verb
    - Comes from the construction -(ㄴ/는)다고 하는 것

Both patterns take the form of the indirect quotation pattern (이)라고 하다 and (ㄴ/는)다고 하다. So literally you could translate it to being the “Noun” that is called and the “Verb” that is called. This literal translation of the noun structure is quite close whilst the verb translation needs more explanation.
