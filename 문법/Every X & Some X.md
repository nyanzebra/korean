# 모든

The most common way to say “every _____” is to place the word ‘모든’ before a noun. 모든 looks, sounds, and acts like an adjective, but it can not be used to predicate a clause or sentence. This means that you won’t see the word “모든” at the end of a sentence, just like in English. For example, you can’t say something like:

He is every…

Even though 모든 ends in ~ㄴ (which is the same as all adjectives when placed immediately before a noun to describe them – 예쁜, 아름다운, 똑똑한), the dictionary form of 모드다 does not exist.

However, as I mentioned, (like an adjective) “모든” can be placed before a noun. If you place “모든” before a noun, it has the meaning of “every _____.” For example:

모든 것 = everything
모든 사람 = all people/every person
모든 과일 = all fruits/every fruit
모든 선생님 = all teachers/every teacher

# 다

Another possible word to use in similar situations is 다. 다 is used as an adverb in sentences to indicate that “all” of something is done.

One way this is done is to use it in a sentence with an object to indicate that some action was completed without leaving anything behind. For example:

저는 라면을 다 먹었어요 = I ate all the ramen
저는 숙제를 다 했어요 = I did all of my homework
저는 소설을 다 읽었어요 = I read the whole book – or – I read all the books
저는 월급을 이미 다 썼어요 = I already spent all of my paycheque

# 모두

There is also another word that you should be aware of: “모두,” which has the meaning of “all.” It can generally be used in the following ways:

As an adverb
In these cases, 모두 essentially has the same meaning as “다.” For example:

선생님들은 모두 똑똑해요 = All teachers are smart, which could also be written as:
선생님들은 다 똑똑해요 = All teachers are smart, or
모든 선생님들은 똑똑해요 = Every teacher is smart

In this adverb form, 다 can also be placed after 모두 in the same sentence. For example:

선생님들은 모두 다 똑똑해요 = All teachers are smart

In this adverb form, you would not see particles attached to it.

As a (pro)noun
In these cases 모두 typically means “everybody” or “everything.” Particles are usually attached to it. For example:

모두가 이해했어요 = Everybody understood
모두가 산책하고 있어요 = Everybody is going for a walk

Here’s the part that is a bit confusing. Often times when the sentence structure is just Subject – 모두 – Verb, the ~를 is omitted from 모두. For example:

나는 모두를 이해했어 would be better said as:
나는 모두 이해했어 = I understood everything

# Everywhere/Every time/Everyone

~나 can be added to the words ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘who’ to mean ‘everywhere,’ ‘every time,’ and ‘everyone.’ Particles are usually not added to these words. For example:

어디 = where
어디나 = everywhere

나는 한국에서 어디나 여행하고 싶어 = I (would) want to travel everywhere in Korea
우리는 동남아시아에 어디나 갈 거예요 = We will go everywhere in South East Asia
밥은 어디나 맛이 똑같아요 = Rice tastes the same everywhere

 

언제 = when
언제나 = every time/always

그녀는 언제나 늦게 와요 = She comes late every time
저는 언제나 똑같은 메뉴를 먹어요 = I always eat the same menu
저는 언제나 똑같은 시간에 일어나요 = I always wake up at the same time

 

누구 = who
누구나 = everyone

누구나 그 여자를 알아요 = Everybody knows that girl
누구나 우리 애기를 보고 싶어요 = Everybody wants to see our baby
누구나 한국을 좋아해요 = Everybody likes Korea

# Something/Somewhere/Sometime/Somebody

~ㄴ가 can be added to the words ‘what,’ ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘who’ to mean ‘something,’ ‘somewhere,’ ‘sometime,’ and ‘somebody.’ For example:

뭐 = what
뭔가 = something

The subject and object particles in general can be omitted from any sentence (although I don’t suggest omitting particles until you have a very deep understanding of Korean), but they seem to be more commonly omitted from these types of sentences. Many examples:

나는 방금 뭔가(를) 봤어 = I just saw something a minute ago
등에 뭔가(가) 있어요 = There is something on your back
등에 뭔가(가) 있나요? = Is there something on my back?
저는 팔에 뭔가(가)느껴져요 = I feel something on my arm
저는 뭔가(를) 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat something
저는 뭔가(를) 말하고 싶어요 = I want to say something

 

어디 = where
어딘가 = somewhere

By the nature of the word “somewhere,” you are most likely to use the particles ~에 or ~에서 in these sentences. It would be acceptable to omit the particle ~에 from 어딘가 but less acceptable to omit the particle ~에서. Many examples:

열쇠를 어딘가(에) 뒀어 = I left my keys somewhere
전쟁이 아시아 어딘가에서 났어요 = A war broke out somewhere in Asia
피가 어딘가에서 나오고 있어요 = Blood is coming out of somewhere
저는 그릇을 어딘가(에) 두었어요 = I put the bowl in some place
선생님들이 회의를 어딘가에서 하고 있어요 = The teachers are having a meeting somewhere
저는 휴일에 어딘가에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go somewhere on the holiday
저는 어딘가에서 커피를 마시고 싶어요 = I want to drink a cup of coffee somewhere

 

언제 = when
언젠가 = sometime/someday

~에 is typically not attached to 언젠가. Many examples:

그 날이 언젠가 올 거예요 = The day will come sometime
구름이 언젠가 걷힐 거예요 = The clouds will clear eventually/sometime
저는 언젠가 경찰관이 되고 싶어요 = I want to become a police officer someday
저는 언젠가 중국어도 배우고 싶어요 = I want to learn Chinese as well some day
저는 언젠가 고향에 돌아가고 싶어요 = I want to return (go back) to my hometown some day

When I first learned about this word, I wondered if particles like ~까지 or ~부터 could be attached to it because 언젠가 represents a time. I kept bugging Korean people to try to make me example sentences of these particles attached to 언젠가 and they always came up with nothing. I realized that in both English and Korean, it isn’t logical to make sentences with “until someday” or “from someday.”

 

누구 = who
누군가 = somebody

누군가(는) 너를 찾고 있어 = Somebody is looking for you
저는 누군가의 열쇠를 찾았어요 = I found somebody’s keys
경찰관들은 누군가와 얘기하고 있어요 = The policemen are talking with somebody
누군가가 지갑을 잃어버렸어요 = Somebody lost their wallet
누군가가 그 파일을 저에게 보냈어요 = Somebody sent that file to me

In Lesson 22, you learned about using 어느 in sentences. Another usage of 어느 is to reference a vague place or point in time. I am including this explanation in this section of the lesson because of the similarities with the sentences above.

You would often see this type of thing in stories, poetry or news reports where the specific location does not need to be given. This would be similar to something like this at a start of a story in English:

A long time ago in a far-away castle, or
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away

In this usage, 어느 is commonly placed before a broad indication of time or place. For example:

어느 날 = some day (an ambiguous day)
어느 밤 = some night (an ambiguous night)
어느 겨울 = some winter (an ambiguous winter)
어느 여름 = some summer (an ambiguous summer)
어느 마을 = some village (an ambiguous village)
어느 시장 = some market (an ambiguous market)

Here, the person speaking/writing this way because he/she does not need to specifically reference the time. Some example sentences:

어느 겨울 꽃이 다 사라졌다 = Some winter, all the flowers disappeared
어느 마을에서 애기 두 명이 태어났다 = Two babies were born in some village
그 다음 날, 할머니가 어느 시장을 구경하고 있었다 = The next day, the grandmother was browsing around some market

Again, like I said, you would most likely see these types of sentences used in stories, often setting up the scenario or something within a book.
