- Auxiliary verbs are widely used in Korean. These words have almost lost their nominative function. They are always used together with a preceding main verb.
  
  **VERB + AUXILIARY VERB**
  
  The most important auxiliary verbs are listed below:
  
  1.  **Progressive auxiliary verbs (가다, 오다, 있다, 들다)**
    
    The verbs 가다 and 오다 are used after the stem of the main verb, which takes the suffix 어(아,여).
    
    **Verb stem +어(아,여) +가다/오다**
    
    These constructions express the continuous performance of an action. The construction with the verb 오다 stresses that the movement comes toward the present and is continuous. The construction with the verb 가다 stresses that the movement progresses into the future, away from the present.
    
    Examples:
    
    우리는 모스크바에서 살아왔습니다. "We have lived in Moscow."
    
    그 일이 잘 되어 갑니다. "That work is going on well."
    
    The verb 있다 is used to form the progressive aspect. The auxiliary verb 있다 is used after the stem of the main verb with the suffix -고.
    
    **Verb stem + -고 +있다**
    
    Example:
    
    친구가 지금 기다리고 있습니다. "My friend is waiting now."
    
    The verb들다 is used after the stem of an action verb with the suffix - (으)러.
    
    **Verb stem + - (으)려 + 들다**
    
    This construction expresses the idea of getting down to action.
    
    Example:
    
    그 여자가 말하려 들면 그가 말하지 못하게 막아요. "When that woman tries to say something (starts to try), he doesn't let her talk."
    
  2.  **Terminative auxiliary verbs (내다, 나다, 버리다, 말다, 빠지다, 치우다)**
    
    This type of auxiliary verb shows that the action has been completed or finished. However, every verb has its own shade of meaning (내다- the action is finished completely despite difficulties, 버리다- the action is completed with no room to spare, etc.). The verbs 내다, 버리다, 빠지다, and 치우다 are attached to the stem of the verb with the suffix 어 (아,여).
    
    **Verb stem +****어 (아,여) +내다 ( 버리다, 빠지다, 치우다)**
    
    **The verbs** 나다 and 말다 are attached to the stem of the verb with the suffix - 고.
    
    **Verb stem + -****고 +나다 (말다)**
    
    **Examples:**
    
    학생은 이 책을 끝까지 읽어 냈어요. "The pupil has read the book up to the end."
    
    숙제를 하고 나서 잠을 잘 거에요. "I will go to bed after finishing my homework."
    
    오늘 지하철에서 지갑을 잃어 버렸어요. "Today I lost my wallet in the subway."
    
  3.  **Donatory auxiliary verbs (주다, 드리다)**
    
    **These auxiliary verbs are used after the stem of the main verb with the suffix 어 (아,여).**
    
    **Verb stem +어 (아,여) + 주다 ( 드리다)**
    
    Grammatical constructions with these verbs show that the action is performed for the benefit of somebody.
    
    드리다 is the honorific form.
    
    Example:
    
    동생은 어머니를 도와 드렸어요. "My little brother helped our mother."
    
    이것을 설명해 주시겠습니까? "Could you explain this to me, please?"
    
  4.  **Exploratory auxiliary verbs (보다)**
    
    **This auxiliary verb is added to the stem of the main verb with the suffix 어 (아,여).**
    
    **Verb stem +어 (아,여) +보다**
    
    This form shows that a person attempts to make an action or has the experience of doing something.
    
    Example:
    
    선생님의 말을 들어 보세요. "Listen to the teacher."
    
    This form is also used in first person questions that ask permission to do something.
    
    Example:
    
    이 소포를 선박우편 보내 볼까요? ###  예, 그럽시다. "Shall I send this parcel by sea mail? - Yes, do that.
    
  5.  **Iterative auxiliary verbs (대다)**
    
    This verb is used after the stem of the main verb with the suffix 어 (아, 여).
    
    **Verb stem + 어 (아,여) + 대다**
    
    This construction is used to show that the action is repeated to an extreme limit.
    
    Example:
    
    이 여자는 공연히 웃어 댑니다. "This woman always laughs without any reason."
    
  6.  **Retentive auxiliary verbs (놓다, 두다)**
    
    These auxiliary verbs are used after the stem of the main verb with the suffix 어 (아, 여).
    
    **Verb stem + 어 (아,여) + 놓다 ( 두다)**
    
    This grammatical construction is used to show that the action is completed and can't be changed or is done for some future use.
    
    Example:
    
    문을 열어 놓았어요. "I left the door open."
    
    이 책은 책상에 놓아 두세요. "Put this book on the desk, please."
    
  7.  **Desiderative auxiliary verb (싶다)**
    
    This auxiliary verb is used after the stem of the main verb with the suffix -고. This form expresses the wish to do something.
    
    **Verb stem + -고 + 싶다**
    
    **Note:** When this construction is used for the third person, the verb 싶다 is changed to the verb 싶어하다.
    
    Example:
    
    저는 여행을 하고 싶어요. "I want to go traveling."
    
    학생들이 재미있는 책을 읽고 싶어해요. "The students want to read an interesting book."
    
  8.  **Stative auxiliary verbs (있다, 지다)**
    
    These auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem of the main verb with the suffix 어 (아,여). Constructions with this auxiliary verb show that the action or state continues to exist.
    
    The verb 있다 is attached only to action verbs.
    
    Example:
    
    그 남자는 문 앞에 서 있었어요. "This man was standing in front of the door" (the process).
    
    The verb 지다 can be used with both action verbs and descriptive verbs. When it is used with action verbs, it forms a passive voice sentence.
    
    Example:
    
    옥수수가 잘 삶아져서 먹기가 좋은데요. "The corn is good to eat because it has been boiled well."
    
    When the verb 지다 is used with descriptive verbs, it expresses the intensification of the state.
    
    Example:
    
    날씨가 아주 따뜻해지고 있습니다. "It is getting very warm."
    
  9.  **Negative auxiliary verbs (말다, 않다, 아니하다, 못하다)**
    
    Negative auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem of the main verb with the suffix - 지.
    
    **Verb stem + - 지 + 말다 (않다, 아니하다, 못하다)**
    
    These auxiliary verbs are used to form negative sentences. However, the verbs 않다 and 아니하다 have neutral meanings, the verb못하다 has connotations of inability (can't), and the verb 말다 is used to negate verbs in the imperative and propositive forms.
    
    Examples:
    
    일요일에 회사에 가지 않습니다. "On Sunday, I don't go to my office."
    
    이 식당*에서* 담배를 피우지 마십시오. "Please do not smoke in this restaurant."
    
    우리는 자주 만나지 못합니다. "We can't meet often."
    
  10. **Periphrastic auxiliary verb 하다**

    The construction 게 하다 forms causatives.
    
    Example:
    
    부모님은 아이를 공부하게 합니다. "Parents make their children study."
    
    The construction 어 (아, 여) 하다 shows that something must be done.
    
    Example:
