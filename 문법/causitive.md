# Causative sentence 1 – causative verbs( make/have/let someone to do)

사동 means ‘make/have/change someone or something to do’, which is called ‘causative sentence’.  Unlike 피동(passive sentence: [Clike here to study passive voice](https://funkorean4u.wordpress.com/2015/02/23/grammar-%ed%94%bc%eb%8f%99%eb%ac%b8-passive-sentence/)), most 사동 sentences can take objects. Therefore you can make adjectives to be verbs if you use 사동 sentences. For example,

책상이 **높아요**. The desk is high.  
(제가) 책상을 **높여요**. (높이+어요.) I make the desk higher. (높이다 : make it high)

사진을 **봐요**. I am looking at pictures.  
사진을 **보여** 주세요. (보이+어 주세요) Please show me pictures. (to let me look)

There are two ways to make a causative sentence, you can use a causative verb or adding -게 하다 after a verb. If you use a causative verb, it means the action of the subject in the sentence directly affects to the object. If you use -게 하다, then it is usually means that the subject orders/commands/tells the object to do, which is indirect. 

Let’s look at causative verbs first. Causative verbs are already fixed, they have -이-, -히-, -리-, -기-, -우-,-추- in the middle of words.

# Verb+게 하다

As I said above, if you use -게 하다, it usually means a subject orders/commands/tells an object to do the action. For example, **엄마가 아기한테 밥을 먹여요. (먹이다 is the causative verb for 먹다) : In this sentence, the mom is using her hand and feeding the baby. The baby doesn’t do anything except for opening the mouth 🙂**  **엄마가 아이한테 밥을 먹게 했어요. (먹게 하다 is indirect causative by ordering) : In this sentence, the mom told the kid to eat (by him/herself).**  아빠가 아기를 재워요. (재우다 is the causative verb for 자다) : We can imagine that the dad is holding the baby, maybe the dad is singing a lullaby or he is reading a book to put the baby to sleep. 고양이가 저를 못 자게 해요. (자게 하다 is indirect causative by ordering) :  In this sentence, we can imagine that the cat is meowing(maybe shouting) at me and let me not sleep
