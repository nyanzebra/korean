## V1 야 V2 #card
?begin
### Usage
To say one must do v1 to do v2, might easiest to think of it as 'only if X, Y'
### Form


### Restrictions
I noticed that sentences with ~아/어야 usually have a positive outcome after ~아/어야. For example, notice how these two sentences end with an outcome that is positive for the speaker:

Only if we work hard will _we win_  
Only if we add salt will _it be delicious_

This usually appears to be true with ~아/어야. It’s better to use it when the outcome of the sentence is positive. To further explain my point, look at this sentence:

Play[사람들은 물을 마셔야 살아요](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lesson13724.mp3) = Only if people drink water will they live

Living is typically advantageous to people.

You could theoretically create a similar meaning by using the opposite of “drinking” and “living.” For example:

사람들은 물을 안 마셔야 죽어요

Dying is typically disadvantageous to people. Therefore, this sentence would not be said in Korean. Instead, what you would want to say is something like this:

Play[사람들이 물을 안 마시면 죽어요](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lesson13725.mp3) = If people don’t drink water, they die

This doesn’t mean that the grammar within the sentence can’t be negative – but rather the outcome of the sentence usually is not negative. For example, the following sentence (also shown above) ends in 않을 거예요. It is grammatically negative, but the outcome is something positive – not discharging pollution.

공장을 엄격하게 통제해야 오염물질을 배출하지 않을 거예요
	We have to keep the factory under strict control so it doesn't emit pollutants
