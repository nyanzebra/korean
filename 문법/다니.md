## 다니 #card
?begin
### Usage
The **~다니** pattern combines **~(으)니** with **~다** to link a fact or statement with your emotional reaction to it. This involves attaching the suffix to the verb stem, which is the base form of the verb. This is how native speakers often express disbelief, amazement, or even frustration in everyday interactions.

### **Key Uses**

1. To react emotionally to something unexpected.
2. To emphasize a surprising or interesting fact.
### Form
This is the structure to follow when using the 다니 grammar point.

**Verb stem + 다니**

**Adjective stem + 다니**

**Noun + (이)라니**
#### **Verb Stem + 다니**

Let’s start with the verbs, and use **말하다** (to speak) as an example.

The verb stem is **말하**.

Attach **다니** directly to the **verb stem** (**말하**) to express disbelief, surprise, or emotion about an action or statement.

**Example:**

**그 사람이 그렇게 말하다니 놀라워요.**

_(To think that person said that—it’s surprising!)_

💡 **Explanation**:

The sentence expresses surprise about someone’s statement using:
- **그 사람이** (that person) – subject
- **그렇게** (like that) – describes manner
- **말하** (speak) – verb stem
- **다니** – shows disbelief
- **놀라워요** (surprising) – expresses reaction

This pattern emphasizes more shock/surprise than simply saying 말했어요 (said).
