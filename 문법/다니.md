### Notes
Now let’s look at two similar but different sentences:

1. ****그 사람은 한국어를 _잘하다니_ 믿을 수 없어요.**  
    **
2. **그 사람은 한국어를 _잘한다니_ 믿을 수 없어요.** 

These both can be translated as “I can’t believe that he can speak Korean.” But I want to draw your attention to the italicized parts of these sentences: **잘하다니** vs. **잘한다니**. What’s the difference?

The sentence with **잘하다니**, as we learned in part 1, just means “I can’t believe he can speak Korean.” Maybe you met this “he” and was conversing with him in Korean and then you’re talking to another friend about how good he is at speaking the language  

The one with **잘한다니**, however, is a little different. Because you have -ㄴ다니 attached, you’re _quoting what someone else said_, and are reacting _to that quote._ Maybe you’re talking to your friend and they tell you that someone from the US can speak Korean really well. Therefore, you _heard_ that he speaks Korean, and are reacting to _hearing this news_. [**Go!Billy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koeh6hd2_b4) describes it as like saying **“Wow, to _hear_ that he can speak Korean!”** while the first sentence is just “Wow, I can’t believe he can speak it!” Let’s see another example:
