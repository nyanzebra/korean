## 다니 #card
?begin
### Usage
The **~다니** pattern combines **~(으)니** with **~다** to link a fact or statement with your emotional reaction to it. This involves attaching the suffix to the verb stem, which is the base form of the verb. This is how native speakers often express disbelief, amazement, or even frustration in everyday interactions.

### **Key Uses**

1. To react emotionally to something unexpected.
2. To emphasize a surprising or interesting fact.
### **What is the English equivalent of 다니?**

The Korean grammar pattern **다니** is used to express **surprise, disbelief, or emotion (like amazement or disappointment)** about something that has been heard or experienced. It’s often translated into English as:

- “To think that…”
- “I can’t believe that…”
### Form
This is the structure to follow when using the 다니 grammar point.

**Verb stem + 다니**

**Adjective stem + 다니**

**Noun + (이)라니**
#### **Verb Stem + 다니**

Let’s start with the verbs, and use **말하다** (to speak) as an example.

The verb stem is **말하**.

Attach **다니** directly to the **verb stem** (**말하**) to express disbelief, surprise, or emotion about an action or statement.

**Example:**

**그 사람이 그렇게 말하다니 놀라워요.**

_(To think that person said that—it’s surprising!)_

💡 **Explanation**:

The sentence expresses surprise about someone’s statement using:
- **그 사람이** (that person) – subject
- **그렇게** (like that) – describes manner
- **말하** (speak) – verb stem
- **다니** – shows disbelief
- **놀라워요** (surprising) – expresses reaction

This pattern emphasizes more shock/surprise than simply saying 말했어요 (said).
#### **Adjective Stem + 다니**

**Now, for the adjective 맛있다** (to be delicious).

The adjective stem is **맛있**.

Attach **다니** to the **adjective stem** (**맛있**) to show an emotional reaction or amazement about the described quality.
**Example:**

**이렇게 맛있다니 믿을 수 없어요.**

_(I can’t believe it’s this delicious!)_

💡 **Explanation**:
The example above shows amazement about taste using:

- **이렇게** (this much) – indicates degree
- **맛있** (delicious) – adjective stem
- **다니** – expresses surprise
- **믿을 수 없어요** (can’t believe) – reinforces the disbelief

Together, this creates a more emotional expression than the basic 맛있어요 (it’s delicious).

#### **Noun + (이)라니**

Lastly, let’s use the word **꿈** (dream) as an example. Instead of **다니,** you can use **(이)라니** with nouns.

You can use **(이)라니** with nouns (or quoted commands/questions) to express a similar emotional reaction, disbelief, or amazement. For nouns ending in a consonant, use **이라니** (e.g., 꿈이라니).
**Example**:

**이게 꿈이라니 믿기지 않아요.**

_(To think that this is a dream—I can’t believe it.)_

💡 **Explanation**:
The sentence expresses disbelief about a dream using:

- **이게** (this) – subject
- **꿈** (dream) – noun
- **이라니** – shows disbelief (used because 꿈 ends in a consonant)
- **믿기지 않아요** (can’t believe) – expresses reaction

This structure conveys more emotion than the simple statement 꿈이에요 (it’s a dream).
