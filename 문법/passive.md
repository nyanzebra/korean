# 피동문 – Passive Sentence](https://funkorean4u.wordpress.com/2015/02/23/grammar-%ed%94%bc%eb%8f%99%eb%ac%b8-passive-sentence/)

In active voice sentences, subjects ‘do’ some actions while subjects ‘get/receive’ some actions in passive voice sentences.

(내가) 문을 열었다. I opened the door. **(active voice)**  
문이 열렸다.  The door is open. (by wind/someone) **(passive voice)**

There are two ways to make a passive sentence in Korean. The first one is with ‘passive verbs’, and the other one is ‘Verb+아/어/여지다’.  For example,

**경찰**이 **도둑**을 잡았다. (잡다 : to catch, grab) – Police caught a thief.  
**도둑**이 **경찰**한테 잡혔다. (잡히다 : be caught) – A thief was caught by police.

or

**동생**이 **접시**를 **깼다**. (깨다 : to break) – My sister broke a plate.  
**접시**가 **깨졌다**. (깨어지다 => 깨지다 : be broken) – A plate was broken.

If a verb has a passive form, you should use the passive form. If not, you use -아/어/여지다.

Passive verbs are already fixed, mostly are added **-이-**, **-히-, -리-, -기-** after a verb stem. For example,

- **Verbs with -이-**

Passive voice is often confusing with causative sentences which are ‘make/have/let someone do’, but they are different.
